// wedgeWatcher detects the "Claude TUI ignored SIGWINCH" failure mode
// non-invasively from the daemon's outbound PTY pipeline. The bug
// surfaces as: a SetSize completes successfully (kernel fires SIGWINCH
// at the foreground process group), but the application's renderer
// stays frozen at the old geometry — so the screen ends up split,
// half-stale, with the prompt drawn below the visible viewport.
//
// Two complementary signals are tracked per session:
//
//  1. **Silent post-resize**: a healthy TUI emits hundreds-to-thousands
//     of redraw bytes within ~200 ms of SIGWINCH. If the window after
//     SetSize is conspicuously quiet for the configured deadline and
//     the previous window was active, we flag a candidate wedge.
//     Heuristic — false positives possible when the app is genuinely
//     idle or mid-inference, so the deadline is generous.
//
//  2. **Cursor-row > current rows**: a wedged renderer keeps writing
//     CUP / HVP escape sequences (`\x1b[<row>;<col>H` or `…f`) that
//     reference rows from the OLD geometry. We parse outbound bytes
//     and any CUP whose row exceeds the current row count, observed
//     while a resize is pending, is a confirmed wedge: the app is
//     provably drawing for stale dimensions. No false positives —
//     a correctly-resized app cannot legally emit those.
//
// Detected wedges are logged via slog AND appended (best-effort) as
// de-identified JSON records to {stateDir}/wedge-events.jsonl. The
// record carries only metrics — no session ID, no name, no PTY
// content, no env, no paths — so the file is safe to attach to an
// upstream bug report.
// WedgeNotice is the cross-package value the wedge watcher pushes to
// its onWedge subscriber on every detection. Mirrors the JSONL record
// shape but lives in the session package so callers outside protocol/
// don't depend on the wire types — the transport layer maps this to
// protocol.WedgeDetected when it pushes to the attached client.
