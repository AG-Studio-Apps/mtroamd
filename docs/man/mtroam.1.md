# NAME

mtroam - manage and attach to remote mtroamd terminal sessions

# SYNOPSIS

**mtroam** *command* [*options*] [*arguments*]

# DESCRIPTION

**mtroam** is the laptop / desktop client for **mtroamd**(8). It speaks
the same mtRoam protocol the iOS meshTerm app speaks, but renders the
remote session in your local terminal instead of an on-device view.

Use **mtroam** when you want persistent shell sessions across SSH drops,
sleeps, and network changes; the same sessions reachable from iOS *and*
the laptop (start a build on your phone in the morning, reattach from
the laptop in the afternoon); or out-of-band management of remote
daemons (list / kill / rename / status) without opening a separate SSH
window.

**mtroam** is **not** an SSH client. It shells out to your system
**ssh**(1) for the bootstrap step, inheriting **~/.ssh/config**,
**ssh-agent**, **ProxyCommand**, and **ControlMaster** multiplexing. If
`ssh user@host` works, **mtroam** works.

**mtroam** is **not** a replacement for **mtroamd**. The daemon still
needs to be running on the remote host; **mtroam** is a client only.

# COMMANDS

**version**, **\-\-version**, **-v**
:   Print the build identifier and exit.

**list** [**\-\-host** *user@host*] [**\-\-json**] [**\-\-timeout** *dur*]
:   Enumerate live sessions on the remote daemon.

**session-info** [**\-\-host** *user@host*] [**\-\-json**] *id*
:   Print one session's detail (attach state, geometry, idle).

**status** [**\-\-host** *user@host*] [**\-\-json**]
:   Print the remote daemon's operational snapshot (uptime, QUIC addr,
    session count, idle policy, certificate fingerprint).

**new** [**\-\-host** *user@host*] **\-\-name** *NAME* [**\-\-idle-timeout** *DUR*] [**\-\-persist** | **\-\-no-persist**]
:   Create a new named session without attaching. **\-\-persist** /
    **\-\-no-persist** override the daemon-wide persistence default
    for this specific session; absent means inherit the daemon
    default (typically on).

**attach** [**\-\-host** *user@host*] [**\-\-mode** {*exclusive*|*readonly*}] [**\-\-predict** {*always*|*adaptive*|*never*}] [**\-\-persist** | **\-\-no-persist**] *id-or-name*
:   Attach to a session as your local terminal. If the named session
    doesn't exist, **attach** creates it. Use **\-\-mode readonly** to
    watch without sending input. **\-\-predict** controls predictive
    local echo: *always* always underlines unconfirmed predictions,
    *adaptive* (default) underlines only when smoothed RTT exceeds
    ~80ms, *never* disables prediction entirely. **\-\-persist** /
    **\-\-no-persist** apply only on fresh spawn — reattach inherits
    whatever the original session was created with.

    In an attached session, two escape chords are honoured on a
    fresh line:

    - `~.` — detach. Closes the QUIC connection cleanly; the remote
      shell stays alive on the daemon.
    - `~?` — print a one-shot info block to stderr: smoothed RTT,
      session ID, attach mode, peer count.

**tail** [**\-\-host** *user@host*] [**\-\-timeout** *DUR*] *id-or-name*
:   Passive-attach a session's live output — receives bytes only,
    sends nothing, leaves the local terminal in cooked mode so the
    invocation can be piped (`mtroam tail dev | grep ERROR`). Unlike
    **attach**, **tail** does NOT create-if-missing — it refuses
    unknown selectors so a typo can't spawn a phantom shell. The
    passive mode is invisible to other clients (doesn't appear in
    **list**'s `AttachedModes`). Up to 8 passive attachers per
    session, daemon-enforced. Exit on Ctrl-C, peer close, or read
    error.

**search** [**\-\-host** *user@host*] [**\-\-json**] [**\-\-max** *N*] [**\-\-anchored**] *id-or-name* *regex*
:   Regex-grep a session's scrollback ring. SSH-wraps **mtroamd
    session-search**(8); see that man-page entry for pattern
    semantics. **\-\-anchored** wraps the pattern in `(?m:…)` for
    line-wise `^`/`$`. **\-\-max** caps result count (default 100).

**doctor** [**\-\-host** *user@host*] [**\-\-json**] [**\-\-timeout** *DUR*]
:   Diagnose the remote daemon. Runs **mtroamd doctor --json** over
    SSH, then adds the laptop-side checks: SSH reachability
    (implicit), mtroam-vs-daemon version skew. Exit 0 on a clean
    report, 1 if any warning surfaced (daemon down, unit-file
    misconfigured, linger disabled, version skew).

**kill** [**\-\-host** *user@host*] *id-or-name*
:   Reap a session by SessionID or by user-visible Name. Glob patterns
    (`*`, `?`, `[...]`) and **\-\-all** are supported.

**rename** [**\-\-host** *user@host*] *id-or-name* *new-name*
:   Change a session's user-visible name. PTY and scrollback buffer
    are unaffected.

**update** [**\-\-check**] [**\-\-yes**] [**\-\-tag** *vX.Y.Z*] [**\-\-allow-downgrade**]
:   Apply a signed self-update from GitHub Releases. Verifies the
    SHA-256 manifest's minisign signature against the embedded primary
    + emergency public-key roster, then verifies the binary's SHA-256
    against the manifest, then atomically swaps **~/.local/bin/mtroam**.
    Anti-rollback is on by default; pass **\-\-allow-downgrade** to
    install an older tag.

**restart** [**\-\-host** *user@host*] [**\-\-timeout** *DUR*]
:   Cycle the remote daemon via its supervisor (systemd-user, launchd,
    or nohup fallback). In-flight sessions survive the restart — see
    **mtroamd**(8) for the v0.6 pty-sidecar architecture. Default
    timeout 45s (exceeds the daemon's own 30s restart timeout so the
    SSH side outlasts the inner call).

**uninstall** [**\-\-yes**]
:   Remove the **mtroam** binary at **~/.local/bin/mtroam**. **mtroam**
    has no state directory of its own.

**help**, **\-\-help**, **-h**
:   Print top-level usage. Per-subcommand flags are listed by
    `mtroam <subcommand> --help`.

# OPTIONS

**\-\-host** *user@host*
:   SSH target running **mtroamd**. Defaults to **$MTROAM_HOST**, then
    to the contents of **~/.config/mtroam/host**.

**\-\-json**
:   Emit machine-readable JSON instead of the default text/tabwriter
    table. Wire shape matches what the iOS app consumes.

**\-\-timeout** *DUR*
:   Per-invocation SSH dial / command timeout (e.g. `5s`, `2m`). Only
    affects management commands; **attach** holds the connection until
    detach.

**\-\-mode** *MODE*
:   For **attach**: *exclusive* (default; sends stdin) or *readonly*
    (watcher; renders output, drops local stdin).

# ENVIRONMENT

**MTROAM_HOST**
:   Default SSH target for every subcommand. Overridden by **\-\-host**.

**SSH_AUTH_SOCK**, **\-\-ssh-***\ flags
:   Inherited via the system **ssh**(1); see **ssh_config**(5).

# FILES

**~/.config/mtroam/host**
:   Fallback default for **\-\-host** when **$MTROAM_HOST** is unset.
    Single-line file containing *user@host*.

**~/.local/bin/mtroam**
:   Conventional install path. **update** and **uninstall** target
    this path.

# EXIT STATUS

0
:   Success.

1
:   Generic failure (or, for **update \-\-check**, "update available").

2
:   Bad flags, missing config, or user cancellation.

3
:   SSH / remote-command failure, or signature verification failure
    (treat as a security event when emitted from **update**).

4
:   Network / download failure during **update**.

# EXAMPLES

Attach to a session, creating it if missing:

    mtroam attach --host user@example.com my-session

Discover what's live on a host:

    MTROAM_HOST=user@example.com mtroam list
    mtroam list --json | jq '.sessions[].name'

Self-update to the latest signed release:

    mtroam update --yes

# SECURITY

The trust chain mirrors the iOS app. Authentication and host trust
piggyback on standard SSH — **mtroam** never sees your password or key.
The QUIC connection's certificate fingerprint is pinned via the
bootstrap line printed by **mtroamd connect** on the remote side; a
mismatch (MITM, regenerated cert) is hard-fail. Self-update verifies
both the minisign signature on **SHA256SUMS** and the per-binary
SHA-256 before the atomic swap; the trusted-key roster is embedded in
the binary at build time.

See **mtroamd**(8) for the daemon's threat model.
