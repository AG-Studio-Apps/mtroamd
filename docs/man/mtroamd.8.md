# NAME

mtroamd - persistent terminal session daemon over QUIC

# SYNOPSIS

**mtroamd** *command* [*options*] [*arguments*]

# DESCRIPTION

**mtroamd** holds persistent terminal sessions on a host across
network drops, device sleep, and client reconnects. Sessions live as
long as the daemon does; any number of clients (the iOS app
**meshTerm**, the **mtroam**(1) laptop CLI, or anything else that
implements the documented mtRoam protocol) can attach, detach, and
re-attach without losing scrollback or shell state.

A persistent shell on the host is reachable from multiple devices: a
session started on a phone in the morning can be resumed from a laptop
in the afternoon. This is the workflow **mosh**(1) + **tmux**(1)
deliver in two tools; **mtroamd** consolidates them into one daemon
with a modern transport (QUIC, with reconnect-and-replay-from-ack) and
real scrollback through every disconnect.

# COMMANDS

**version**, **\-\-version**, **-v**
:   Print the build identifier and exit.

**serve** [*options*]
:   Run the long-lived daemon. Owns the session registry, accepts
    incoming QUIC connections, and serves a local IPC socket for the
    SSH bootstrap helper. Normally launched by a supervisor (systemd-user,
    launchd, or nohup fallback) rather than directly.

    Notable flags: **\-\-addr** (QUIC bind), **\-\-socket** (IPC
    socket path), **\-\-max-sessions** (concurrent session cap),
    **\-\-idle-timeout** / **\-\-max-idle-timeout** (per-session GC
    knobs), **\-\-session-buffer-bytes** (per-session output ring
    buffer; default 4 MiB, raise for hosts where you want richer
    reattach-replay history during long output-heavy builds),
    **\-\-persistence-default** {*on*|*off*} (daemon-wide default for
    cross-restart session persistence; on means new sessions
    checkpoint scrollback to disk so they survive daemon update and
    host reboot; clients can override per-session via **mtroamd
    connect \-\-persist** / **\-\-no-persist**),
    **\-\-persistence-flush-interval** (snapshot cadence; default 30s).

**connect** [*options*]
:   SSH-side bootstrap helper invoked by the meshTerm iOS app (or by
    **mtroam attach**). Allocates a single-use attach token, looks up
    or spawns the requested session, and prints a single bootstrap
    line on stdout:

        MTRM_QUIC 1 <port> <sid_hex_32> <fp_hex_64> <tok_hex_32>

    Then exits. Not intended for direct interactive use.

**list** [**\-\-json**]
:   Enumerate live sessions on the local daemon. JSON output is the
    wire shape iOS and **mtroam**(1) consume.

**session-info** [**\-\-json**] *id*
:   Print one session's detail (attach state, geometry, idle).

**status** [**\-\-json**]
:   Print the daemon's operational snapshot (uptime, QUIC bound
    address, session count, idle-timeout config, attach-token pool
    size, certificate fingerprint).

**session-search** [**\-\-json**] [**\-\-max** *N*] [**\-\-anchored**] *id-or-name* *regex*
:   Regex-grep a session's scrollback ring buffer. The pattern is Go
    RE2 source; **\-\-anchored** wraps it in `(?m:…)` so `^`/`$` match
    physical newlines in retained bytes (the truncated start of the
    ring is NOT treated as `^`). **\-\-max** caps result count
    (default 100; 0 = daemon default of 10,000). The daemon-side ring
    buffer is byte-addressed, so seq offsets in the result reference
    monotonic positions usable with the protocol-level replay path.

**doctor** [**\-\-json**]
:   Compile a diagnostic report combining live daemon health (via
    Status IPC), the detected supervisor backend, on-disk unit /
    plist inspection (including the load-bearing `KillMode=process`
    check for v0.6+), and `loginctl` linger status on Linux. Exit 0
    on a clean report, 1 if any warning surfaced. The `--json` shape
    is consumed by **mtroam**(1) and the iOS app.

**kill** *id-or-name*
:   Reap a session by hex SessionID or by user-visible Name. Supports
    glob patterns and **\-\-all**.

**rename** *id-or-name* *new-name*
:   Change a session's user-visible Name. PTY and scrollback buffer
    are unaffected.

**update** [**\-\-check**] [**\-\-yes**] [**\-\-tag** *vX.Y.Z*] [**\-\-allow-downgrade**] [**\-\-force**]
:   Apply a signed self-update from GitHub Releases. Same verification
    chain as **mtroam update**: minisign signature on **SHA256SUMS** via
    the embedded primary + emergency key roster, per-binary SHA-256
    against the manifest, atomic file replace, then **svcmgr.Restart**
    via the detected supervisor.

**restart** [**\-\-timeout** *DUR*]
:   Cycle the daemon via the detected supervisor (systemd-user, launchd,
    or nohup fallback). In-flight sessions survive the restart - the
    v0.6 pty-sidecar architecture keeps PTYs alive in sidecar processes
    while the daemon reattaches them via FrameResume on next boot. No
    confirmation prompt; matches **systemctl restart**'s UX. Default
    timeout 30s.

**uninstall** [**\-\-purge**] [**\-\-yes**]
:   Stop the daemon, remove the supervisor unit, remove the binary.
    **\-\-purge** also wipes **~/.local/share/mtroamd/** (certificate,
    state, logs).

**help**, **\-\-help**, **-h**
:   Print top-level usage. Per-subcommand flags via
    `mtroamd <subcommand> --help`.

# OPTIONS

Common flags accepted by most subcommands:

**\-\-json**
:   Emit machine-readable JSON instead of the human-readable table.

**\-\-yes**
:   Skip the interactive confirmation prompt (**update**, **uninstall**).

**\-\-tag** *vX.Y.Z*
:   For **update**: target a specific signed release tag instead of
    the latest. The tag is validated against
    `^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-[0-9A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z.-]*)?$` and rejected
    otherwise.

**\-\-allow-downgrade**
:   For **update**: permit installing a tag older than the running
    version. Off by default so a flipped GitHub "latest" pointer or a
    typoed **\-\-tag** can't silently roll back to a known-vulnerable
    build.

**\-\-force**
:   For **update**: reinstall the target tag even when it already
    matches the running version (bypasses the up-to-date short-circuit;
    signature + checksum verification still apply).

# FILES

**~/.local/bin/mtroamd**
:   Conventional install path for the daemon binary.

**~/.local/share/mtroamd/**
:   State directory: self-signed TLS cert, IPC socket, daemon PID
    file. Wiped by **uninstall \-\-purge**.

**~/.config/systemd/user/mtroamd.service** (Linux, systemd-user)
:   Supervisor unit when systemd-user is the detected backend.

**~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agstudio.mtroamd.plist** (macOS)
:   Supervisor plist when launchd is the detected backend.

**~/.local/share/mtroamd/mtroamd.log** (nohup fallback)
:   Append-only log when neither systemd-user nor launchd is available.
    Owner-only mode (0600). Pre-v1.0 versions wrote to /tmp/mtroamd.log;
    if you upgrade an existing nohup deployment, the old file is
    orphaned and may be safely deleted.

# NETWORK

**mtroamd** listens for QUIC on a configurable address (default
**0.0.0.0:49820** when installed via the iOS app's nohup path,
**127.0.0.1:0** when the library defaults are used). If the preferred
port is in use, the daemon falls through to the next free port in the
49820–49919 range and persists the chosen port across restarts. ALPN
**meshterm/0**. TLS 1.3 only, pinned curves X25519 + P-256. Datagrams
enabled. The QUIC certificate's fingerprint is what every client pins;
no SNI, no hostname verification, no CA chain.

Default per-server concurrency cap: 64 in-flight handlers. Over-cap
peers receive CONNECTION_CLOSE with application code 0x10F.

# AUTHENTICATION

Every QUIC attach requires a single-use 16-byte attach token with a
30-second TTL. Tokens are minted by **mtroamd connect** in response
to an SSH-authenticated request from the user-controlled SSH client.
There is no separate PSK, password, or key configured in the daemon -
the trust model is "you control SSH, you control the daemon."

# EXIT STATUS

0
:   Success (or, for **update**, "already on this version").

1
:   Generic error (or, for **update \-\-check**, "update available").

2
:   Bad flags or user cancellation.

3
:   Verification failure (treat as a security event when emitted from
    **update** - signature didn't match, key not in roster, or
    SHA-256 mismatch).

4
:   Network / download failure during **update**.

5
:   For **update**: binary was swapped successfully but
    **svcmgr.Restart** failed. Restart the daemon manually to pick up
    the new build.

# SECURITY

See **docs/SECURITY.md** in the source tree for the full threat model
and trust assumptions, including:

- Attacker classes (local-user, on-path, hostile mirror, jailbroken
  client).
- Cryptographic primitives (Ed25519 for minisign, BLAKE2b-512 for
  pre-hashed mode, ECDSA P-256 for the daemon's QUIC certificate).
- Audit findings and their remediations (the **\-\-tag** validator,
  the IPC concurrent-connection cap, and the minisign parser fuzz
  target ship in this version).

# EXAMPLES

Start the daemon manually for debugging:

    mtroamd serve --addr 0.0.0.0:49820

Enumerate live sessions:

    mtroamd list --json

Self-update to the latest signed release:

    mtroamd update --yes
