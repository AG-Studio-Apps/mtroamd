#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# provision-keys.sh — generate the mtroamd release-signing key roster.
#
# What this does (once, on your workstation):
#   1. Generates a PRIMARY minisign keypair (used by CI for every signed release).
#   2. Generates an EMERGENCY minisign keypair (kept offline; iOS trusts it as a fallback).
#   3. Encrypts both private halves with age + a single passphrase you choose.
#   4. Pushes the encrypted private halves + plaintext public halves to
#      AG-Studio-Apps/meshterm_keys (private repo, encrypted backup).
#   5. Sets MINISIGN_KEY and MINISIGN_PASSWORD as Actions secrets on
#      AG-Studio-Apps/mtroamd so release CI can sign without you.
#   6. Shreds the unencrypted private files from your workstation.
#   7. Prints the two PUBLIC keys in the exact base64 form to embed in iOS.
#
# You will be prompted for passphrases several times during the run.
# READ the on-screen instructions for each prompt — minisign -G asks for
# its passphrase twice (generate + confirm), and the script needs the
# same passphrase a third time to upload it to GitHub Secrets.
#
# Public keys printed at the end are NOT secrets — paste them into the
# conversation so they can be committed into iOS source.
